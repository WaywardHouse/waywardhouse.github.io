This site is a static publication hosted on GitHub Pages. It does not run a database, does not require login, and does not collect personal data.

## What is stored

- **Theme preference** — stored in your browser's `localStorage`. Never transmitted anywhere.
- **Reading progress** — if you mark an essay as complete, that state is stored in your browser's `localStorage` under a key specific to that essay's URL. It stays on your device, is never transmitted, and can be cleared by clearing your browser's site data.
- **GitHub Pages** — GitHub may log standard web server data (IP address, browser, pages visited) as part of hosting. See [GitHub's privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
