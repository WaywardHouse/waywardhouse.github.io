Wayward House publishes two kinds of work. Here's where to begin with each, and where to go next.

## Political economy: how places actually work

These essays examine specific cases — Alberta, energy markets, trade structures — to understand the systems underneath. No assumed economics background; primary sources throughout.

**Suggested sequence:**

1. [A Trade Reality Check](/alberta-trade-reality-check/) — What Alberta produces, what it exports, and what it depends on from the rest of Canada
2. [The Texas of the North](/texas-of-the-north/) — How the analogy holds up, and where it breaks
3. [Global Energy Markets](/global-energy-markets/) — Where Alberta's output fits in the broader picture

## Computational geography: from first principles

A structured series building quantitative and computational geography from algebra upward. Each essay adds one concept; later essays depend on earlier ones. Code for each piece is published openly on GitHub.

**If you're new — start here:**

1. [What Is a Spatial Model?](/what-is-a-spatial-model/) — Variables, units, and the discipline of thinking in fields *(Level 1)*
2. [Linear Change and Rate](/linear-change-and-rate/) — Slope as the fundamental measure of how things change *(Level 1)*
3. [Exponential Growth and Logarithms](/exponential-growth-and-logarithms/) — When change compounds on itself *(Level 1)*

**If you have a calculus background:**

Pick up at [Logistic Growth and Equilibrium](/logistic-growth-and-equilibrium/) or browse [Cluster B](/series/) for terrain and spatial analysis.

**If you're interested in a specific domain:**

- *Terrain and topography* — Digital Elevation Models as Functions, Gradient and Aspect
- *Orbital geometry* — Earth as a Rotating Sphere, Circular Orbits and Kepler's Third Law
- *Hydrology* — Hydrological Flow as Optimization

## Code and open publishing

All computational essays are accompanied by Python code, published in open GitHub repositories. The essays explain the mathematics and reasoning; the repos contain runnable implementations.

This site is itself open — built with Jekyll and published on GitHub Pages. If you spot an error or want to discuss a derivation, open an issue or use the discussion threads below each essay.
