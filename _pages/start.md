Wayward House publishes two kinds of work. Here's where to begin with each.

## If you're interested in political economy

How do places actually function — economically, politically, ecologically? These essays work through specific cases to understand the systems underneath.

1. [A Trade Reality Check](/alberta-trade-reality-check/) — What Alberta produces, exports, and depends on from the rest of Canada
2. [Texas of the North](/texas-of-the-north/) — How the Alberta analogy holds up and where it breaks
3. [Global Energy Markets](/global-energy-markets/) — Where Alberta's output fits in the broader picture

## If you're new to computational geography

A structured sequence building from first principles. Each piece adds one idea; later pieces depend on earlier ones.

1. [What Is a Spatial Model?](/what-is-a-spatial-model/) — Variables, units, and the discipline of thinking in fields
2. [Linear Change and Rate](/linear-change-and-rate/) — Slope as the fundamental measure of how things change
3. [Exponential Growth and Logarithms](/exponential-growth-and-logarithms/) — When change compounds on itself
