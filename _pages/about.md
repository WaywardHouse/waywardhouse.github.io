Waywardhouse is an independent publishing project focused on economic geography, environmental systems, and political economy. The work here sits at the intersection of place, ecology, and the political structures that shape both.

## What gets published here

Long-form analysis and essays on:

- **Economic geography** — how economic activity is spatially organised, and why location still matters
- **Environmental systems** — the physical and ecological systems that underpin economies and communities
- **Political economy** — who benefits, who bears costs, and how those distributions get decided

## Editorial approach

This is independent work — no institutional affiliation, no funder to satisfy. Analysis follows evidence. Where there are contested empirical questions, they're treated as such. Where there are genuine value disagreements, those are distinguished from empirical ones.
