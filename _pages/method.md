Waywardhouse draws on methods from several disciplines without being captive to any of them.

## Analytical framing

The core question is usually: how does this system work, and for whom? That requires understanding physical and ecological constraints, economic incentives, and political structures simultaneously — because they shape each other.

## Modelling

Where quantitative models appear, they are used as a thinking tool rather than a prediction machine. Models make assumptions explicit. The interesting questions are usually about what the model can't capture.

## Geographic specificity

Abstract analysis often fails at the level of place. The work here tries to stay grounded in how things actually function in specific locations — the landscape, the infrastructure, the institutional history, the people.

## Sources

Primary sources where possible. Where secondary sources are used, they're cited. Contested empirical claims are flagged as such.
