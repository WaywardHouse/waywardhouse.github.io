## Series Overview

Atmospheric hazards—wildfires, tornadoes, floods—kill thousands annually and cause billions in damages. This series develops predictive models from atmospheric physics and fluid dynamics, enabling forecasting, warning, and risk assessment. Emphasis on operational decision-making under uncertainty.

## Pedagogical Philosophy

**Lives depend on forecasts.** Unlike academic exercises, hazard predictions have immediate human consequences. We emphasize probabilistic forecasting, warning lead times, and false alarm rates.

**Coupling across scales.** Microscale (fire spread), mesoscale (thunderstorms), synoptic (derechos). Processes interact hierarchically.

**Observations constrain models.** Radar, satellites, surface stations provide real-time validation. Students compare predictions to observations.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Calculate fire danger indices** from meteorology and fuel conditions
2. **Model wildfire spread** using Rothermel equation and elliptical growth
3. **Estimate smoke dispersion** via Gaussian plume models
4. **Assess severe weather potential** from CAPE, shear, environmental parameters
5. **Predict tornado intensity** from damage indicators and radar signatures
6. **Forecast hail size** from updraft strength and growth processes
7. **Derive IDF curves** for rainfall intensity-duration-frequency
8. **Perform flood frequency analysis** via Log-Pearson Type III
9. **Design urban stormwater systems** with detention and green infrastructure
10. **Quantify forecast uncertainty** and communicate risk effectively

## Mathematical Progression

**Fire:** Exponential models, diffusion equations, wind fields

**Severe weather:** Thermodynamics, vorticity, buoyancy integrals

**Floods:** Probability distributions, extreme value theory, routing equations

## Computational Skills

- Fire spread algorithms (cellular automata, Huygens principle)
- Atmospheric sounding analysis
- Radar data processing (reflectivity, velocity)
- Statistical distribution fitting
- Hydrologic modeling (HEC-HMS concepts)
- Monte Carlo for probabilistic forecasts

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Series 1 (differential equations, statistics)

**Helpful:** Series 2 Essays 13-16 (atmospheric energy balance)

## Entry Points

**Fire management:** Essays 60-62 self-contained

**Meteorology students:** Essays 63-67 (severe weather + wind)

**Hydrology/engineering:** Essays 68-70 (flood analysis)

**Emergency management:** All clusters relevant; start with hazard of interest

## Key Insights

1. **Atmospheric instability quantifiable.** CAPE, shear, moisture indices predict severe weather objectively.

2. **Fire behavior exponentially sensitive.** Small weather changes produce dramatic spread rate changes.

3. **Tornadoes remain partially unpredictable.** Environmental parameters necessary but not sufficient.

4. **Return periods misunderstood.** 100-year flood has 1% annual chance, not "once per century."

5. **Urbanization amplifies flooding.** Impervious surfaces increase peaks 2-5×.

6. **Uncertainty communication critical.** Probabilities, not deterministic predictions.

7. **Warning lead time saves lives.** Doppler radar increased tornado warning time from 5 to 15 minutes.

## Applications

- Wildfire risk assessment and evacuation planning
- Severe thunderstorm warnings (NWS operations)
- Tornado damage surveys (EF-Scale rating)
- Hail suppression programs
- Wind energy resource assessment
- Culvert/bridge design (flood frequency)
- Stormwater management ordinances
- Flood insurance rate maps (FEMA)

## Operational Context

**National Weather Service:** CAPE/shear for convective outlooks, radar for warnings

**Fire agencies:** NFDRS, WFAS for resource pre-positioning

**USGS:** StreamStats for flood frequency, real-time streamgages

**FEMA:** Flood Insurance Studies use methods from Essays 68-70

## Extensions

**For climate:** Hazard frequency changes under warming (future series)

**For risk analysis:** Loss estimation, cost-benefit (future)

## Estimated Time

**Per essay:** 4-5 hours

**Full series:** 45-55 hours

**Fire sequence (60-62):** 12-15 hours

**Severe weather (63-65):** 12-15 hours

**Floods (68-70):** 12-15 hours
