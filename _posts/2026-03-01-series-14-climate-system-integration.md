## Series Overview

Series 13 taught individual GHG processes — combustion, photosynthesis, methanogenesis. This series couples those processes into a full climate system. We move from component budgets to feedbacks, from bottom-up inventories to top-down atmospheric inversions, from current observations to future scenarios. The central question: given what we can measure, what can we say with confidence about how the climate system will evolve?

## Pedagogical Philosophy

**Series 13 taught components. Series 14 teaches coupling and feedbacks.** Students must understand individual GHG processes before tackling coupled climate-carbon dynamics.

**Mass balance as fundamental framework.** Every GHG budget follows: Sources − Sinks = Atmospheric Change. This principle connects disparate processes.

**Uncertainty is quantifiable.** Every flux has error bars. Monte Carlo propagation, not point estimates.

**Observation + modelling synergy.** Atmospheric measurements provide top-down constraint. Process models provide bottom-up estimates. Reconciliation reveals knowledge gaps.

**Tipping points and feedbacks.** Permafrost thaw, ocean carbon saturation, wetland emissions — positive feedbacks that could accelerate warming beyond simple projections.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Construct complete carbon budgets** from fossil fuels, land use, ocean, and atmosphere
2. **Build national GHG inventories** by sector using IPCC methods
3. **Estimate land use change emissions** from remote sensing and carbon stocks
4. **Quantify methane sources** from wetlands, agriculture, fossil fuels, and permafrost
5. **Model permafrost feedbacks** and project emissions under warming scenarios
6. **Apply inverse modelling** to infer fluxes from atmospheric observations
7. **Interpret satellite GHG measurements** to detect emission hotspots
8. **Quantify carbon-climate feedbacks** and feedback strength parameters
9. **Project temperature trajectories** under SSP scenarios using energy balance models
10. **Communicate uncertainty** with confidence intervals, not false precision

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Series 1 (calculus, ODEs), Series 2 Essays 13–16 (energy balance), Series 13 (GHG fundamentals — all clusters)

**Helpful:** Series 5 (remote sensing for satellite data essays), Series 6 Essay 62 (fire emissions)

## Entry Points

**Carbon focus:** Essays 127–129 self-contained for carbon budget and land use

**Methane and feedbacks:** Essays 130–132 build on Series 13 methane essays

**Observations track:** Essays 134–135 can be read with Series 5 remote sensing background

**Projections:** Essay 137 requires Essay 136 but can be read with basic climate model intuition

## Key Insights

1. **Mass balance reveals gaps.** Residual terrestrial sink highlights major uncertainty in the carbon cycle.

2. **Methane acceleration is worrying.** Post-2007 growth not fully explained; atmospheric inversions and isotopic data provide key constraints.

3. **Permafrost is a tipping point.** Contains 2× atmospheric carbon; thaw emissions poorly constrained but potentially catastrophic.

4. **Observations constrain models.** Top-down atmospheric measurements are essential for validating bottom-up inventories — neither alone is sufficient.

5. **Feedbacks amplify forcing.** Positive carbon-climate feedbacks could add 20–40% to emissions by 2100, compounding human emissions.

6. **Uncertainty is large but bounded.** Wetland CH₄ uncertain ±50%, permafrost feedback by factor of 3. Science must communicate this honestly.

7. **Multiple GHGs matter.** CH₄ short-lived but potent; N₂O small but persistent. CO₂-equivalent accounting is essential.

8. **Attribution is quantitative.** Isotopes, inversions, and remote sensing together separate natural vs anthropogenic, fossil vs biogenic.
