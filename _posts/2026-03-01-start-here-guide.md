## What Is This?

The Computational Geography Laboratory is a modular essay system teaching geography as a quantitative modeling discipline. Seventy essays develop mathematical, computational, and spatial reasoning through observable Earth phenomena—from snowmelt physics to tornado dynamics, from satellite remote sensing to urban flood modeling.

This is **not** a traditional textbook. Essays are self-contained, interconnected, and entry-anywhere. You chart your own path based on interests and background.

## Series Dependencies

```
Series 1 (Foundations)
    ├─→ Series 2 (Environmental Systems)
    │       └─→ Series 4 (Cryosphere)
    │       └─→ Series 6 (partial - hazards)
    ├─→ Series 3 (Spatial Analysis)
    │       └─→ Series 5 (Remote Sensing)
    └─→ Series 5 (direct if comfortable with math)
    └─→ Series 6 (direct if comfortable with math)
```

**Series 1 is foundational** but not strictly required for all paths. Advanced students can start Series 3, 5, or 6 directly if mathematical background sufficient.

## Philosophy: Why This Matters

Geography has been dismissed as "not rigorous" compared to physics, engineering, mathematics. This is wrong. Spatial systems are modelable, quantifiable, and predictive. Geography provides:

- **Spatial structure** absent from aspatial models
- **Scale hierarchies** linking process to observation  
- **Human-environment coupling** essential for sustainability
- **Observable validation** from satellites, sensors, field campaigns

This curriculum demonstrates that **geography is a quantitative science** with mathematical depth rivaling traditional STEM disciplines.
