## Series Overview

Greenhouse gas accounting begins with individual processes — a coal plant burning carbon, a forest absorbing CO₂, a rice paddy releasing methane — and builds toward the full global budget. This series develops the quantitative foundation for understanding how carbon and methane move through the Earth system, using stoichiometry and mass balance rather than vague assertions. Every flux is derived, every emission factor justified from first principles.

## Pedagogical Philosophy

**One process at a time.** Begin with single fluxes: combustion chemistry, photosynthesis, air-sea exchange. Understand each mechanism before combining into budgets.

**Stoichiometry and mass balance.** Every calculation starts with balanced chemical equations and conservation of mass. Units tracked rigorously.

**Derive, don't assert.** Emission factors, uptake rates, atmospheric lifetimes — all derived from fundamental chemistry and physics, not looked up in tables (though we validate against published values).

**Hand calculations first.** Work through carbon balance for a forest stand, a coal plant, a hectare of rice paddy by hand before scaling to global budgets.

**Build complexity incrementally.** Single flux → process pair → sector budget → regional budget → global budget.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Calculate combustion emissions** from fuel carbon content and stoichiometry
2. **Quantify carbon stock changes** from land use conversion
3. **Estimate photosynthetic uptake** from light-use efficiency
4. **Model air-sea CO₂ exchange** via Henry's Law and gas transfer velocity
5. **Calculate soil carbon turnover** from first-order kinetics
6. **Understand methanogenesis** in anaerobic environments
7. **Compute methane atmospheric lifetime** from OH sink
8. **Build farm-scale GHG inventories** using IPCC Tier 1 methods
9. **Close a complete carbon budget** and quantify residual uncertainties
10. **Calculate agricultural N₂O emissions** and evaluate mitigation options

**Cluster AN:** Light-use efficiency models, Henry's Law, first-order rate kinetics

**Cluster AO:** Anaerobic pathway stoichiometry, atmospheric lifetime from burden/sink ratio

**Cluster AP:** Mass balance closure, uncertainty propagation, Monte Carlo

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Series 1 (calculus, ODEs), Series 2 Essays 13–16 (energy balance), Essay 26 (carbon cycle basics)

**Helpful:** Series 6 Essays 61–62 (fire spread and emissions), chemistry background (stoichiometry)

## Entry Points

**Carbon accounting:** Essays 115–117 (sources) and 118–120 (sinks) can be read together before the budget essays

**Methane focus:** Essays 121–123 self-contained for agricultural methane

**Budget builders:** Essays 124–126 require earlier clusters but can be skimmed before diving deeper

## Key Insights

1. **Mass balance reveals gaps.** The terrestrial sink is a residual — high uncertainty signals what we don't yet understand.

2. **Fossil vs biomass emissions differ fundamentally.** Fossil adds new carbon; biomass burning recycles active carbon — but timing of regrowth matters.

3. **Methane lifetime is a feedback.** Rising CH₄ consumes OH, extending its own lifetime — a positive feedback.

4. **Agricultural CH₄ is manageable.** Water management and feed additives can cut emissions 30–80%.

5. **N₂O is persistently dangerous.** 110-year atmospheric lifetime; every kilogram stays problematic for generations.

6. **Uncertainty is quantifiable.** E_FF ±5%, E_LUC ±50%, S_LAND ±100%. Knowing uncertainty structure matters as much as the central estimate.
