  Alberta has 12% of the population but generates 32% of Canadian exports. It

## 1. Alberta's Economic Scale

Before examining trade flows, it helps to understand Alberta's sheer economic weight. With just 4.9 million people — about 12% of Canada's population — Alberta punches far above its demographic weight in virtually every economic measure that matters.

## 2. What Alberta Actually Produces

Alberta's economy rests on a remarkably concentrated production base. Energy dominates, but agriculture and services play significant supporting roles.

### 2.1 Energy: The Foundation

Alberta sits atop one of the world's largest proven oil reserves — the oil sands of the Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River regions.[^lop]

[^lop]: Library of Parliament, Trade and Investment Profile: Alberta, 2024.

| Product | Export Value (2024) | % of AB Exports | Notes |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Crude petroleum oils | $124.2B | 67.8% | Primarily oil sands bitumen/SCO |
| Hydrocarbon gases (nat. gas, LPG) | $8.7B | 4.7% | Gaseous + liquefied propane |
| **Total energy products** | **$132.5B** | **72.5%** | **Down from ~80% a decade ago** |
| Light petroleum products (imports) | ($8.2B) | — | Alberta imports refined products |

### 2.2 Agriculture: The Underappreciated Pillar

Alberta's agricultural sector is the second major production story — one that rarely receives adequate attention.[^ab-ag]

[^ab-ag]: Alberta.ca, Agricultural Trade Services, 2024.

| Commodity | Value / Scale | National Significance |
|:---|---:|:---|
| Total agri-food exports (2024) | $17.5B | ~20% of all Canadian agri-food exports |
| Primary products | $7.8B | Grains, oilseeds, livestock |
| Value-added products | $9.7B | Processed meats, canola oil, whiskey |
| Beef exports | $3.6B | 43% of Canada's cattle on AB farms |
| Potatoes | Leading province | 23.7% of Canadian potato production |
| Honey & hemp | Largest producer | #1 in Canada for both |

Alberta's beef processing capacity is nationally dominant. Over three-quarters of all Canadian beef processing occurs in Western Canada, with the majority concentrated in Alberta. This creates supply chain interdependencies that flow both ways.

## 3. International Trade: Where Alberta's Exports Go

### 3.1 The Export Numbers

In 2024, Alberta exported $183.2 billion in goods internationally — a 98% increase from 2020's $92.5 billion, driven by rising oil prices and increased production volumes.[^wte]

[^wte]: World's Top Exports analysis of Statistics Canada data; Export Alberta 2024.

<div data-viz="echarts" style="height:320px" data-options='{
  "title": {"text": "Alberta Export Destinations (2024)", "left": "center"},
  "tooltip": {"trigger": "axis", "axisPointer": {"type": "shadow"}},
  "grid": {"left": "20%", "right": "15%"},
  "xAxis": {"type": "value"},
  "yAxis": {"type": "category", "data": ["Rest of World", "South Korea", "Japan", "China", "United States"]},
  "series": [{"type": "bar", "data": [12, 1.5, 2.5, 5.5, 162.1], "label": {"show": true, "position": "right", "formatter": "${c}B"}}]
}'></div>

| Destination | Value (2024) | % of AB Exports | Trend |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| United States | $162.1B | 88.5% | +3.7% year-over-year |
| China | ~$5–6B | ~3% | Rising post-TMX pipeline |
| Japan | ~$2–3B | ~1.5% | Stable, LNG focus |
| South Korea | ~$1.5B | ~0.8% | Growing |
| Rest of World | ~$12B | ~6.5% | Fragmented |
| **Total** | **$183.2B** | **100%** | |

> **88.5% of Alberta's exports go to one country.** This is the defining structural fact of Alberta's trade position, and the central vulnerability in any scenario involving a break with Canada or serious trade disruption with the U.S.
{:.callout}

### 3.2 The TMX Pipeline Effect

The Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline entered commercial operation in May 2024, nearly tripling capacity for moving Alberta crude to the Pacific coast at Burnaby, B.C. The numbers remain modest.

| Period | AB Crude to Asia | Context |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Pre-TMX (before May 2024) | ~0% | Virtually no direct Asian market access |
| Post-TMX (late 2024) | ~4.1% of crude exports | Early-stage ramp-up |
| Theoretical TMX capacity | ~590,000 bbl/day | Vs. AB production of ~3.7M bbl/day |

TMX represents a genuine diversification opportunity, but it is currently marginal relative to total production. The U.S. market dependency will persist for years regardless of pipeline infrastructure.

### 3.3 The Import Side

Alberta's international trade balance is massively positive — $183.2B in exports versus approximately $40B in imports, yielding a $143 billion surplus in 2024.

| Import Category | Value (2024) | Why Alberta Buys This |
|:---|---:|:---|
| Light petroleum products | $8.2B (20% of imports) | Refinery gap — AB produces heavy crude, needs refined |
| Machinery & equipment | Significant | Oil patch capital equipment |
| Chemical inputs | Moderate | Industrial feedstocks |
| Manufactured goods | Varied | Consumer and industrial goods |

## 4. Interprovincial Trade: Alberta Within Canada

International trade numbers — dramatic as they are — tell only part of the story. Alberta is deeply embedded in the Canadian internal market in ways that are less visible but profoundly important.

### 4.1 Alberta's Interprovincial Exports

In 2019 (the most recent detailed pre-COVID data), Alberta exported approximately $68 billion in goods and services to other Canadian provinces.[^atb]

[^atb]: ATB Financial, "Alberta's Exports to Other Provinces," 2019 data.

<div data-viz="echarts" style="height:340px" data-options='{
  "title": {"text": "Alberta Interprovincial Export Composition", "left": "center"},
  "tooltip": {"trigger": "item", "formatter": "{b}: {d}%"},
  "series": [{
    "type": "pie",
    "radius": ["40%", "70%"],
    "data": [
      {"value": 46, "name": "Services"},
      {"value": 32, "name": "Energy Products"},
      {"value": 11, "name": "Agricultural Products"},
      {"value": 11, "name": "Other Goods"}
    ],
    "label": {"formatter": "{b}\n{d}%"},
    "itemStyle": {"borderRadius": 6, "borderWidth": 2}
  }]
}'></div>

| Category | Share of Interprovincial Exports | Key Destinations |
|:---|---:|:---|
| Services | ~46% | B.C., Ontario (professional, financial, energy services) |
| Energy products (petroleum wholesale) | ~30–35% | Ontario, B.C., Saskatchewan, Quebec |
| Agricultural products | ~10–12% | National distribution |
| Other goods | ~7–12% | All provinces |

The services-heavy nature of interprovincial trade is notable: Alberta exports professional expertise, financial services, and energy sector knowledge to the rest of Canada — transactions that do not appear in goods trade statistics but represent real economic value.

### 4.2 What Alberta Buys from Other Provinces

This is the part of the trade picture most often absent from political discussions of Alberta's self-sufficiency.[^ab-ipt]

[^ab-ipt]: Alberta Government, Economic Commentary on Interprovincial Imports, 2014–2016 data.

| What Alberta Buys | Approximate Value (2016 data) | Primary Suppliers |
|:---|---:|:---|
| Total interprovincial imports | ~$67B (2016) | Ontario, B.C., Quebec (top 3) |
| Manufacturing & machinery | Large share | Ontario, Quebec |
| Transportation services | ~$15–20B range | National carriers, B.C. ports |
| Processed foods & beverages | ~$6.2B | Ontario, B.C., Quebec, Prairies |
| Professional & financial services | Significant | Ontario, B.C. |
| Construction materials & inputs | Substantial | B.C., Ontario |

> **In 2016, Alberta's interprovincial imports ($67B) actually exceeded its interprovincial exports ($63B).** Alberta runs a trade surplus with the world but was, in that period, a net importer from the rest of Canada — a wealthy consumer province buying manufactured goods, services, and processed products it does not produce domestically.
{:.callout}

### 4.3 The Interprovincial Dependency Map

The B.C. relationship deserves special emphasis: TMX terminates at Burnaby, B.C. All of Alberta's Asian crude export ambitions run through British Columbia's port infrastructure, regulatory environment, and Indigenous consultation processes. Alberta's market diversification strategy is not independent of the rest of Canada — it is entirely dependent on B.C.'s cooperation.

| Alberta Needs From... | What It Gets |
|:---|:---|
| Ontario & Quebec | Manufactured goods, vehicles, pharmaceuticals, processed food, financial services |
| British Columbia | Port access (critical for any Asian export), forestry products, Pacific trade gateway |
| Saskatchewan & Manitoba | Agricultural inputs, grain transport networks, regional complementarity |
| Atlantic Canada | Limited direct trade, but national market access through national distributors |

## 5. Alberta's Fiscal Position: The Federal Transfer Reality

The trade data tells one story. The fiscal data tells another — and together they explain much of the political tension surrounding Alberta's place in Confederation.

### 5.1 Alberta's Net Contribution to Federal Finances

Alberta does not receive equalization payments — it has not since 1964–65. Because Albertans have higher average incomes, they pay proportionally more federal tax and receive proportionally less federal spending.[^fiscal]

[^fiscal]: Statistics Canada Fiscal Balances; Fraser Institute; Fairness Alberta; Library of Parliament.

}'></div>

| Fiscal Measure | Alberta Data | Context |
|:---|---:|:---|
| Net transfer to Ottawa (2007–2023) | $267.4B total | ~$16–17B/year average |
| Annual net transfer (recent years) | $15–27B/year | Varies with commodity prices |
| AB share of federal taxes paid | ~16–17% | AB has only 12.4% of population |
| Federal spending received per capita (2024) | $2,547/person | 2nd lowest nationally; PEI gets $6,845 |
| CPP net contribution (1981–2022) | $53.6B net paid in | 6× greater than B.C.'s net contribution |
| EI net contribution (1981–2023) | $23.9B net paid in | Only Ontario paid in more |

> **Projections estimate Alberta will contribute $252.5 billion more to Ottawa than it receives back from 2025 to 2039 — approximately $17 billion per year on average.** The imbalance is structural, not accidental.

### 5.2 The Equalization Controversy

Equalization is the most politically charged transfer program. The program exists to ensure provinces can provide "reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation" — a constitutional commitment under s. 36(2) of the *Constitution Act, 1982*.

Alberta's grievances with the formula are substantive. The formula includes a hypothetical Alberta PST in calculating fiscal capacity — penalizing Alberta for not having a sales tax — while simultaneously excluding Quebec's below-market hydro electricity rates. Critics argue this asymmetry penalizes resource-based revenue systems while protecting politically sensitive hydro policies.

The non-binding 2021 referendum, in which 61.7% of Albertans voted to remove equalization from the Constitution, reflects deep frustration with these asymmetries — even as constitutional scholars note Alberta alone cannot change the formula.

## 6. The Dependency Map: Reading the Full Picture

### 6.1 How Alberta Depends on the Rest of Canada

| Dependency | Mechanism | Severity if Lost |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Internal trade market | ~$67B+ in annual interprovincial imports | Major — disrupts supply chains |
| Port access (TMX/Pacific) | All Asian export routes go through B.C. | Critical for diversification |
| Pipeline right-of-way | Trans Mountain crosses B.C.; federal approval required | Existential for current exports |
| Currency union | Canadian dollar pricing for global commodity sales | Complex to replicate |
| Financial system | Bay Street capital, Canadian banking regulation | Significant transition costs |
| Trade agreements | CUSMA negotiated as Canada, not Alberta | Would need renegotiation from scratch |
| Regulatory frameworks | National food safety, transportation, securities | Expensive to duplicate |

### 6.2 How Canada Depends on Alberta

| Dependency | Mechanism | Scale |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Export revenues | 32.2% of all Canadian international exports | Existential for national trade balance |
| Federal tax base | $68.8B federal revenue from AB (2025 est.) | ~16–17% of federal revenues |
| CPP sustainability | $53.6B net contribution (1981–2022) | Program would need restructuring |
| EI sustainability | $23.9B net contribution (1981–2023) | Program would need restructuring |
| Energy supply | Most Canadian provinces buy AB energy | Some would face supply disruption |
| Agricultural exports | ~20% of all Canadian agri-food exports | National food export capacity |

> **The interdependence is real and runs in both directions.** The question is not whether Alberta needs Canada or Canada needs Alberta — both are demonstrably true. The question is whether the terms of that interdependence are fair, and whether the political relationship reflects the economic reality.

## 7. Five Facts That Should Ground Every Policy Debate

**First: Alberta's exports are 88.5% U.S.-bound.** The primary dependency risk is the U.S. relationship, not the Ottawa relationship. TMX has opened Asian markets, but they represent roughly 4% of crude exports today.

**Second: Alberta runs a trade surplus with the world but is a major net buyer from other Canadian provinces.** The "we don't need them" narrative collides with a ~$67B annual flow of manufactured goods and services moving into Alberta.

**Third: Alberta's fiscal contribution to Confederation is historically large and structurally significant.** $267.4 billion transferred to Ottawa above what Alberta received back (2007–2023) is documented Statistics Canada data. The frustration has a legitimate empirical foundation, even where proposed remedies are contested.

**Fourth: Alberta's market diversification goals depend on infrastructure that crosses other provinces.** TMX terminates in Burnaby. Alberta's Pacific export strategy requires B.C.'s ports and continued national support for pipeline infrastructure.

**Fifth: The energy economy is an extraordinary asset — and an extraordinary concentration risk.** Crude oil and gas are 72.5% of Alberta's exports. This concentration created the wealth that funds the fiscal transfers — and the vulnerability that makes Alberta dependent on national frameworks, stable U.S. relations, and pipeline access.
