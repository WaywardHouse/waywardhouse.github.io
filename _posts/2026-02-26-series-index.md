## About This Series

The **Computational Geography Laboratory** is a structured curriculum that teaches geography through mathematical modeling and computational thinking. Unlike traditional textbooks, this is a modular system where each essay is self-contained but part of a coherent learning architecture.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Geography is a modeling discipline, not just memorization
- Mathematics should be derived, not asserted
- Computation makes models tangible
- Physical and human geography share mathematical structures
- Visualization deepens understanding

## Design Principles

1. **Mathematics must be derived, not asserted**  
   Every equation is built from first principles or clearly stated assumptions.

2. **Units must always be tracked**  
   Dimensional analysis prevents errors and clarifies meaning.

3. **Vector geometry introduced visually before symbolically**  
   Geometric intuition precedes algebraic manipulation.

4. **Human geography treated quantitatively**  
   Social and economic processes follow mathematical patterns too.

5. **Interaction used only when it deepens understanding**  
   Visualizations serve pedagogy, not decoration.

6. **Essays remain modular; coherence emerges through tagging**  
   You can start anywhere, but structured pathways guide progression.
