## Design Notes

### Series 4-6 Assumptions
- Require Series 1-3 as prerequisites
- More specialized/advanced topics
- Still maintain pedagogical structure (derivations, worked examples, interactive viz)
- All Pi-compatible where possible

### Priority Order
1. Complete Series 4 (Cryosphere) - directly extends existing terrain/hydrology work
2. Series 5 (Advanced Remote Sensing) - extends Series 3 Cluster N
3. Series 6 (Atmospheric Hazards) - extends Series 2 atmospheric/energy balance work
